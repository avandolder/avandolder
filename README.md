- ðŸ”­ I spent last summer implementing new features into Spidermonkey, particularly the Iterator Helpers and Private Methods Javascript proposals.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Programming Languages and Type Theory as I work through Types and Programming Languages.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything PL related! Compilers, JITs, transpilers, whatever!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email works fine!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did I mention I really like programming languages?
