### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**avandolder/avandolder** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing new features into Spidermonkey, particularly the Iterator Helpers and Private Methods Javascript proposals.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Programming Languages and Type Theory as I work through Types And Programming Langauages.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything PL related! Compilers, JITs, transpilers, whatever!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email works fine!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really like programming languages!
